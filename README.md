# My Problem Solving Submissions Editorial #
Hello there! :smiley: If you're searching for a place to learn how to solve problems, and not just find the answers, then I have great news for you :sparkles: - you've come to the right place :books:! 

My name is Mohammadreza, and in this repository, I will do my best to explain my LeetCode submissions. I want to clarify that the solution I am sharing is not the only way to solve the problem, and perhaps not even the best way! However, I believe it is easy to code and easy to remember for future use. I'll share my thought process :thought_balloon: as I tackle a problem, and I'll help you follow the same procedure for similar questions. 

I suggest spending :hourglass: ***at least one hour*** :hourglass: trying to solve the problem yourself before checking out my editorial if you're unable to solve it. Doing so will help you understand better and improve your problem-solving skills after each attempt :chart_with_upwards_trend:. 

I hope that you find this repository helpful :white_check_mark:.

## My "General :trollface: " Procedure for Problem Solving ##
1. **DO NOT RUSH**:grey_exclamation: <br> It is important to read the problem description carefully and precisely, even when you are in a programming competition with a time limit. Rushing through the description can cause you to misunderstand the problem, and as a result, you may end up spending more time coding the wrong answer than it would take to figure out what the question really wants. Thus, taking your time to understand the problem is essential for success.
2. **Remeber** the similar problem ðŸ’¡ **Remember** the idea ðŸ’¡ <br> This is the key step that helps you get the `Accepted`, and get better at problem-solving over time. After reading the problem description, start recalling similar questions you've solved before. Try to remember the idea you used to solve them and explain in one sentence why the current question requires a similar approach.
3. Challenge Acce......pted :heavy_check_mark: <br> Consider the constraints given in the problem description. Check the time limit and memory limit. Make sure the combination of your idea and the constraints satisfies the limits. By this point, you must have figured out how exactly this problem challenges you and what is your approach to tackling it. Do not ignore this. Only by doing this, you can make sure you are ready to start coding.
4. Code it and Get Accepted, then **Think** on it! :shipit: <br> Once you've got the "Accept", there is one final step to complete. You need to come up with a label for the idea behind this problem. You don't have to only use formal or well-known labels like "DP" or "Greedy". Instead, use any label that will help you remember how you solved the problem in the future. By working through the problems in this repository, you'll become more familiar with this concept.

### 1. LeetCode: Two Sum Problem [[Link]](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/ "LeetCode Submission Link") <a name="twosum"></a>

#### Description

> Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
> You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
> You can return the answer in any order.

> Example 1: <br> Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 <br> Output: [0,1] <br> Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]. <br> Example 2: <br> Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6 <br> Output: [1,2] <br> Example 3: <br> Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6 <br> Output: [0,1]

> Constraints: <br> 2 $\le$ `nums.length` $\le$ 10<sup>4</sup> <br> -10<sup>9</sup> $\le$ `nums[i]` $\le$ 10<sup>9</sup> <br> -10<sup>9</sup> $\le$ `target` $\le$ 10<sup>9</sup> <br> + Only one valid answer exists.

### 2. LeetCode: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock [[Link]](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/) "LeetCode Submission Link") <a name="besttimetobuyandsellstock"></a>

#### Description

> You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the i<sup>th</sup> day.
<br> You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. <br> Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

> Example 1: <br> Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4] <br> Output: 5 <br> Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5. <br> Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell. <br> Example 2: <br> Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1] <br> Output: 0 <br> Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 
> Constraints: <br> 1 $\le$ `prices.length` $\le$ 10<sup>5</sup> <br> 0 $\le$ `prices[i]` $\le$ 10<sup>4</sup> <br>
