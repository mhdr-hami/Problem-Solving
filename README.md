## my LeetCode Submissions Editorial ##
Hello there! :smiley: If you're searching for a place to learn and not just find answers, then I have great news for you - you've come to the right place :sparkles:! 

My name is Mohammadreza, and in this repository, I will do my best to explain my LeetCode submissions. I'll share my thought process :thought_balloon: as I tackle a problem, and I'll help you follow the same procedure for similar questions. 

I suggest spending ***at least one hour*** :hourglass: trying to solve the problem yourself before checking out my editorial if you're unable to solve it. Doing so will help you understand better and improve your problem-solving skills after each attempt :chart_with_upwards_trend:.

## 1. LeetCode: Two Sum Problem <a name="LeetCode_TwoSum"></a>

#### Description
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9

Output: [0,1]

Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6

Output: [1,2]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6

Output: [0,1]
