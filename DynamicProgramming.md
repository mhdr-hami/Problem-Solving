# My Understanding of Dynamic Programming :eight_spoked_asterisk: #

Nobody denies that Dynamic Programming is almost everywhere that problem-solving matters. Whether it's an interview or a programming contest like ICPC, DP problems will always challenge you (maybe not that much, perhaps a lot). If you are a person who likes to be challenged, you always will enjoy solving DP problems as there exists a mystery you have to solve at your very first steps.

I want to share my experience with dynamic programming in this document. I will explain how I recognize a problem as DP and the thought process I use to solve it. Additionally, I will include the editorial for any DP problem I solve, which can also be found on the homepage readme. I understand that there are many excellent resources available for learning DP, but I hope that sharing my experience will help someone (even if it's just myself!) to gain a better understanding of dynamic programming. ❤️
